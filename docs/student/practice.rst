Click on the desired StudentQuiz activity to open it.
Now you are in the main view of this StudentQuiz.
If none has contributed any question yet, you only see a button to add a new question.

See :ref:contribute for more information about contributing a question.

As soon as more than one question was contributed before, the question bank
displays all of them on the bottom half of the view.

On the upper half a filter section provides various selectors to filter the questions below.
This is especially recommended when a lot of questions have been added to this StudentQuiz.

Use the filter and the checkboxes to select the questions you want to practice now.

As soon as you are happy with your selection hit the "Start Quiz" button.

StudentQuiz will now instantiate a Quiz with your selected questions for you.

When ever you answer a question you are required to rate the question on a scale of 1 to 5 stars.

Your teacher might have given you some guidelines based on what criteria you should rate the questions.

The author of the question will recieve award points based on your rating.

See :ref:score to learn more about the award points.
