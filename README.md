# moodle-mod_studentquiz

The studentquiz activity is an activity for students to add and share questions.
Students can add question to the studentquiz and see only those questions. They have the 
opportunity to add questions, search or filter them and start a quiz from the questions
to practice.

### Create new studentquiz

In the create activity screen it has two specific options:

#### Anonymize creator and ranking for students

The anonymize option hides the creator information in table (ranking and question) for students. If it is active the students can only filter his own 
questions but not others.

#### Quiz Practice Settings

In this setting you can choose which question behaviour is active for the students practice quizzes.
