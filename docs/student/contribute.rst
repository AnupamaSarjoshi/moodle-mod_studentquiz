Commenting a question
---------------------

If your teacher has enabled the studentquiz question behavior, you 
can comment every question you answered. You can discuss the solution 
or the question in the comments. They won't be shown to someone who 
hasen't answered the question yet.

Your teacher can decide, whether your name will is displayed or anonymized
as the author of the comment.

For more information about your score and ranking see :ref:`Score <student_score>`

Rating a question
-----------------

If your teacher has enabled the studentquiz question behavior, you will 
be asked to rate each question you answered for it's usefulness and 
suitability for you. Your teacher might have given you some guidance on 
what is considered to be a question, but in the end it is you and your 
fellow students enrolled in the class that define the rating of the 
questions within StudentQuiz.
